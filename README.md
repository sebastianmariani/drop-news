# Drop News

Drop News allow the use to avoid being overwhelmed by the pace of nowadays news. I created a simple and less cluttering experience to keep up with the news around the world, with the possibility to select the category that the user is interested in and to choose between different country around the world. In this project I used **React**,**Hooks**, **Sass** and News API to retrieve the latest news.
